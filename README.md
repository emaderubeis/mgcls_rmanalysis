# Useful scripts for RM analysis of MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS) data

The main script (and relative utilities) is thought to extract RM information from MGCLS Stokes Q and U cubes, using RM-tools (https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM-Tools) for RM-synthesis, with the aim of producing RM grid and profiles. It is fine-tuned to work with MGCLS data, so please feel free to adapt it for your own purposes. !! work in progress !!<br>

In the `utilities` folder there are various scripts used for polarization analysis from my Master degree thesis project. See [De Rubeis et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A..23D/abstract) for more details. They have barely been touched since then, use it at your own risk!
